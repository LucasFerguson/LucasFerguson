👋 Hi, I’m @LucasFerguson

CS student finishing a combined bachelor’s + master’s degree at Illinois Institute of Technology.
Interested in DevOps and systems work; using tools like Docker, Linux (Proxmox), CI/CD, and infrastructure automation.

I started coding early making small games and projects with p5.js, many of which can still be found here on GitHub (for example, **Space Game 5**: [https://lucasferguson.github.io/Space-Game-5/](https://lucasferguson.github.io/Space-Game-5/)), and over time shifted toward containers, servers, and keeping systems running smoothly.

I **love** my homelab; it’s where I experiment with virtualization, containers, networking, and automation:
